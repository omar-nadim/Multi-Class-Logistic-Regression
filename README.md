# Multi-Class-Logistic-Regression

In this notebook, I will use logistic regression to solve a multi-class classification problem. Since logistic regression is a binary clasification algorithm I will combine many of them to solve this problem.

The idea is to recognize hand written digits to be in (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) So I will use 10 logistic regressions.
